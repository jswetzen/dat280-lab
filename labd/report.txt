The tests we conducted on a single machine were preformed on a four core monster.
We also tried over a network with a iPhone for a router and a five year old
dual-core MacBok Pro as the second participating computer.

The first tests on the single machine were performed with four virtual nodes
and a master node.
The other tests were preformed with 10 nodes, two of them on the MacBook.

The file we were testing on had a size of roughly 8MB.

Our measurements are all in the page_rank.erl file, along with each function.

We had quite disappointing results for our distributed versions. The more work
we put into writing each version, the worse it got. So our naive
implementation was the best one in our tests. There are a few factors that we
believe played a role in this.

- We had too small a file to test on.
- We probably sent too small chunks of data considering the file size.
- Our network setup was far from ideal.
- The two computers weren't equal in hardware. It's possible the MacBook took
  a while to finish its work while the other computer had finished the rest.

We thought the worker pool would perform better than it did, but the chunks of
work were probably not big enough for it to make any difference.
